#  E-Commerce Web Application

##  Project Description
The **E-Commerce Web Application** is a full-stack web platform designed to simulate an online shopping experience.  
It enables users to browse products, view detailed information, manage a shopping cart, and place orders, while administrators can manage products and users through a dedicated admin interface.

The project focuses on **modern web development practices**, **clean user interface design**, **secure backend APIs**, and **real-world application structure** using the MERN-style architecture (without exposing sensitive data).

This application is developed as a **learning-oriented and academic project**, showcasing full-stack development skills.
